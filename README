A Ruby on Rails done by a noob..
I did this as one of my first exercices in Rails so there's some dirty code. If I had to do it now I would do it differently.
Anyway...
I used gravatar and devise and calendar-event gems.

event-calendar provided the month view, and I wrote my own day view, finding a hard time in creating the +1 day and -1 day links because of all the different 31/30/29/28 days and that stupid 4 year february..
Probably Rails has it's own way of doing this but I tried to code it on my own..

Users can set their presence to events and comment on those. Only the creator of a given event or comment can destroy it. Users can pick a color that will be used to display their events.
